# Artist-Tours-Financial-Performance-Dashboard

#📌 Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into artists’ tours, including their financial performance and attendance trends. The dashboard enables users to analyze Actual Gross revenue, attendance, and performance by tour and country using dynamic visualizations and filters.

The dataset (ArtistTours.xlsx) contains two Excel worksheets that were modeled and visualized in Power BI.

##📊 Features / Requirements Implemented
#✔️ 1. Data Modeling

Imported and modeled data from two Excel worksheets contained in the ArtistTours file.

Ensured relationships supported filtering and aggregation across tours and countries.

#✔️ 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Three KPI cards were created to summarize tour performance:

Total Actual Gross across all tours

Average Actual Gross per tour

Maximum Actual Gross among all tours

All KPIs were formatted appropriately (millions/billions) for readability.

#✔️ 3. Filters / Slicers

Added a Country slicer to filter the entire dashboard.

All visuals update dynamically when a country is selected.

The dashboard includes:

Bar Chart: Sum of Actual Gross by Tour Name

Sorted from highest to lowest

Clear axis labels and formatted numbers (e.g., 0.5bn)

Additional Visual:

Average attendance per show

Optional visuals to improve insight generation

#✔️ 5. Formatting & Design

Consistent color themes across visuals

Readable typography for KPI cards and charts

Layout designed for clarity, simplicity, and professional presentation
